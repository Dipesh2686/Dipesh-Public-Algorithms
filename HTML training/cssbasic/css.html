    <h1>Cricket</h1>
    <p style="background-color:chocolate;font-size: medium;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        A cricket ball is a hard, solid ball used to play cricket. 
        A cricket ball consists of a cork core wound with string 
        then a leather cover stitched on, and manufacture is regulated 
        by cricket law at first-class level. The trajectory of a 
        cricket ball when bowled, through movement in the air, and 
        off the ground, is influenced by the action of the bowler 
        and the condition of the ball and the pitch, while working 
        on the cricket ball to obtain optimal condition is a key 
        role of the fielding side. The principal method through 
        which the batsman scores runs is by hitting the ball, 
        with the bat, into a position where it would be safe 
        to take a run, or by directing the ball through or over the boundary.
